# Ex1-Year-1-semester-1
exercise number 1 for Java, year 1, first semester

Overview:

The Ex1 class contains various functions for handling numbers in various bases, including operations such as converting between bases, validating input
formats, and finding the maximum value in an array of numbers in various bases.

functions:
1. getUserInput()
Prompts the user to enter a number in the required format.

2. stringSplit(String userInput)
Splits the user input into two parts: the number and the base.

4. reverseString(String numberString)
Reverses the given string.

4. Initializa1() and Initializa2()
 Initializa1(): Initializes a dictionary mapping letters (A-G) to their numerical values (10–16).
 Initializa2(): Initializes a dictionary mapping numerical values (10–16) back to letters (A-G).

5. base2Int(String userInput)
Extracts the base from the user input and converts it to an integer.

6. num2Decimal(String numberStr, String baseStr)
Converts a number from the specified base to its decimal representation.

7. number2Int(String userInput)
Converts a user input string to its decimal representation.

8. isNumber(String userInput)
Validates if the user input is in the correct format and if the digits in the number are valid for the given base.

9. int2Number(int naturalNum, int base)
Converts a natural (decimal) number to a string in the specified base.

10. equals(String n1, String n2)
Checks if the value of two nambers is equal by comparing their decimal representations.

11. maxIndex(String[] arrStr)
Finds the index of the largest number in an array of strings.
